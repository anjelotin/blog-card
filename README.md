## What I learned

During this challenge, I focused on:

- Structuring HTML using semantic elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, or `<article>`.
- Using CSS Flexbox for layout.
- Creating a layout that adapts to mobile and dektop screen sizes.
- Understanding how `object-fit`, `aspect-ratio`, and `box-shadow` can change design and image handling.
